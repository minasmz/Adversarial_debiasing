# Adversarial_debiasing
Improved adversarial_debiasing.py code from AIFair360 by adding "equal opportunity" fairnness measurement as described in the "Mitigating Unwanted Biases with Adversarial Learning" paper.

Also, you are able to save and restore the trained Tensorflow model which is not available in the code in AIFair360
